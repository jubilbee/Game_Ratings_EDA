<h1 align='center'><b> Game Ratings </b></h1>

## Overview
This project looks at game data from the IGDB API, with the goal of determining what genres, themes, and keywords are most common in released games, as well as determining which genres, themes, and keywords appear in highly rated games. This will give insight into what trends in video games occur as far as type of gameplay and focus material, as well as providing a look into what types of games players enjoy playing.
## Data
The data in this project comes from the [Internet Game Database]() using API calls to retrieve data regarding video games, their initial release dates and year released, the genres, themes, and keywords the games are tagged with, as well as the total rating and number of ratings the game received.
